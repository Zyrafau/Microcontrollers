This repository contains:

1. Akcelerometr

This STM32 NUCLEO-F303RE with KA-Nucleo-Multisensor project receives SPI's data measured in three dimentions by built-in accelerometer sensor,
displays it on 4 digit 7 segment LED display and transmits it using UART.


2. RGB

This Arduino Uno project enables to control one RGB LED in any desirable way.


3. budzik

This Arduino Uno project shows current time on 4×7 display in HH:MM format.
It's been poorly handled and requires improvements.


4. servo_game

This Arduino Uno project lets you play with the microcontroller. Thanks to photoresistors it shows position of your finger. It is cure for boredom!

version: servo


5. snake

This STM32 NUCLEO-F303RE project lets you play snake game on 8×8 (1088BS) LED matrix.
It has both visual and auditory outputs thanks to mounted buzzer.

Controls:

– UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT – control snake direction,

– BLUE PUSHBUTTON – pause current game,

– BLACK PUSHBUTTON (RESET) – start new game,

– potentiometer – set speed (before starting new game).


6. step_game

This Arduino Uno project lets you play with the microcontroller. Thanks to photoresistors it shows position of your finger. It is cure for boredom!

version: 28BYJ-48 5V stepper motor with ULN2003 driver


7. the_office

This Arduino Uno project lets you hear intro of one of "the Office" TV series in 1-bit audio quality straight from mounted buzzer.


8. uart

This STM32 NUCLEO-F303RE project lets you transmit data using UART.
